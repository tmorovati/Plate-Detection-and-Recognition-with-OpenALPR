## Description

This project focuses on place detection and recognition using the OpenALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) repository. By leveraging OpenALPR's capabilities on Persian Numbers, we have developed a system for recognizing and categorizing locations within your university's parking areas. The system utilizes license plate recognition technology to identify and classify parking spots, contributing to efficient management and navigation.

**Warning: Dataset belongs to Persian Numbers

## Features

- Automatic license plate recognition using OpenALPR.
- Classification of parking spots and recognition of their availability.
- Customizable for different parking environments.
- Preprocessing of data for improved accuracy.

## Data Sources

The project uses data from your university's parking areas, including images, license plate information, and location details. The data is collected from various sources within your university's parking management system.

## Preprocessing

Before using OpenALPR, we have implemented preprocessing steps in C++ to enhance the accuracy of the recognition process. These preprocessing steps may include image enhancement, noise reduction, and data conditioning.
